Crystal collector game

#### Gitpage: https://ekaterinashainiak.github.io/Crystal-collector-game/

#### Here's how the app works:

   * You will be shown a random number between 19 - 120 at the start of the game.

   * When you clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. The game will hide this amount (hidden value between 1 - 12)  until you clicks a crystal.

   * You win if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * You lose if your score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever you win or lose.

     * When the game begins again, you should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, your score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
